Hello everyone!I am building a simple interpreter for C language. Thanks to this project i wanted to learn more about C# languages and look on difference between Java and C#. Interface of the developed program work only in Windows, but core work in Windows and in Linux.
Created interpreter can translate small C to NASM code, and after compile this NASM code.
I used IDE VS 2022. Version .NET Core is 3.1.

Main idea i get from Ruslan Spivak blog.
